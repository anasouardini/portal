# Portal

A very basic script for jumping to/from paths without having to do write the whole path, open multiple terminal sessions or (god forbid) do a file system search using `fzf`.

# usage
If you type `ph` you'll get available options that look like this:
`options: create (pc) | jump (pj) | delete (pd) | list (pl) | help (ph)`
