# Portal (zsh-zap plugin)

A very basic script for jumping to/from paths without having to write the whole path, open multiple terminal sessions or do a file system search using `fzf`.

# install
In your `zsh` session, with `zsh-zap` installed, run: `plug anasouardini/portal`

# usage

## dynamically
`Portal` will make an alias for `cd` that records all the paths you visit and then figure out which one you want to visit if you type an invalid path.

## manually 

If you type `ph` you'll get available options that look like this:
`options: create (pc) | jump (pj) | delete (pd) | empty (pe) | list (pl) | help (ph)`
