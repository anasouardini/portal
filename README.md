# Portal (zsh-zap plugin)

A very basic script for jumping to/from paths without having to write the whole path, open multiple terminal sessions or do a file system search using `fzf`.

# install
In your `zsh` session, with `zsh-zap` installed, run: `plug anasouardini/portal`

# usage

## dynamically
`Portal` will make an alias for `cd` that records all the paths you visit and then figure out which one you want to visit if you type an invalid path.

## manually 

`Portal` also gives you the option to manage your paths/portals manually and assign exact names to retrieve them later. You can also remove and clean the entire list of paths if you want.
