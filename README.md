# Portal (zsh-zap plugin)

A very basic script for jumping to/from paths without having to write the whole path, open multiple terminal sessions or do a file system search using `fzf`.

# install
In your `zsh` session, with `zsh-zap` installed, run: `plug anasouardini/portal`

# usage
If you type `ph` you'll get available options that look like this:
`options: create (pc) | jump (pj) | delete (pd) | empty (pe) | list (pl) | help (ph)`

**HAPPY TELEPORTATION!**
