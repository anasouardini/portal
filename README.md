# Portal (zsh-zap plugin)

https://github.com/anasouardini/portal/assets/114059811/57d9e0e2-2353-4057-9b90-9f08c72ead61

A very basic script for jumping to/from paths without having to write the whole path, open multiple terminal sessions or do a file system search using `fzf`.

# install

In your `zsh` session, with `zsh-zap` installed, run: `plug anasouardini/portal`

If you don't have `zsh-zap` installed, download the script and `source` it in your rc file.

**HAPPY TELEPORTATION!**
